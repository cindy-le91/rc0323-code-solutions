## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
the breakpoint is the point where using media query becomes necessary

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) `width` instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) `width` for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
using a percentage keeps the dimensions proportionate to the rest of the page

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
because of the css rules for specificity. the code that is written last will win out.
