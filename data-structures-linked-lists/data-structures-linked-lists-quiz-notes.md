## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How are linked lists different from an array?
Linked lists use nodes that point to the next node, while arrays use a contiguous block of memory to store elements.
Arrays provide constant-time access to elements, while linked lists require linear time to access elements.
Arrays can be slow for insertion and deletion, while linked lists can be efficient.
Arrays use contiguous memory, while linked lists use non-contiguous memory.

- How would you access an arbitrary node in a linked list (not just the "head")?
To access an arbitrary node in a linked list, you need to traverse the list starting from the head node until you reach the desired node.
